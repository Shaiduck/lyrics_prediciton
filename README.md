# Lyrics prediction
## Comparing Recurrent Neural Networks with Markov Chains in order to predict music lyrics

### by [Alex Ingberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexingberg/)

Currently done:
  - Lyrics in Spanish from [Luis Alberto Spinetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta)

Pulled lyrics from Genius API. Run two different kind of models and compared the modelling, the development and the outcome.

This whole project has been created using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

I created the databases with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
